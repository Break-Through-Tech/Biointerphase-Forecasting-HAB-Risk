## 🏢 About Biointerphase

Biointerphase specializes in the development of advanced biomaterials and biosignal intelligence platforms designed to restore, reinforce, and better understand complex biological systems. Within this framework, our work in the water quality sector applies these capabilities through data‑driven approaches that enable more precise monitoring, prediction, and mitigation of biological risks in aquatic environments.

## 🎯 The Challenge

### Project Summary
In this project, you will use publicly available water quality, meteorological, and satellite-derived environmental data and machine learning techniques such as classification techniques (ex. bloom, at risk for bloom, no bloom, etc.) to build a model that predicts the risk or occurrence of harmful algal blooms, with optional extensions into time-series forecasting that predict the risk, occurrence, or growth of harmful algal blooms. This will help our company address the challenge of developing practical early-warning and monitoring tools for harmful algal blooms to support targeted environmental management decisions.

### Success Criteria
Model performance (Classification: accuracy, precision/recall, F1, ROC-AUC; Regression: RMSE, MAE, R2); integration of multi-source environmental data; clear interpretation of key environmental drivers; and a reproducible, well-documented Python workflow.

### Project Milestones

Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a **GitHub Projects board** to track tasks within each milestone.

| Month | Milestone | Key Activities |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **September** | Data Understanding | Explore dataset, handle missing values, document findings |
| **October** | Model Development | Train baseline model, experiment with approaches, iterate |
| **November** | Evaluation & Presentation | Finalize model, prepare presentation, document results |

> **Note for the team:** Please create a GitHub Projects board in this repository to break these milestones into weekly tasks. Go to the **Projects** tab → **New project** → Choose **Board** → Add columns for each month.

## 🛠️ Suggested Approach

**ML Problem Type:** Classification (primary), Time-Series Analysis (secondary)

**Recommended Libraries:**
- Classification
- Regression
- Time-Series Analysis
- Deep Learning / Neural Networks
- Transfer Learning / Pre-trained Models
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Python

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Accuracy, Precision/Recall, RMSE
- Success will be measured by both model performance and practical usability:
  - **Classification performance** in identifying at-risk and bloom conditions 
  - **Ability to correctly identify "at-risk" conditions**, which are crucial for early intervention 
  - **Interpretability of key environmental drivers** that influence the transition between non-blook, at-risk, or bloom states 
  - **Clarity of outputs**, such that results could be used to support real-world monitoring decisions (ex. additional sampling or mitigation techniques)
